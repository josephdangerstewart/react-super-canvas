# The `IBrush` interface

All super canvas brushes implement this interface and can be made usable in the editor by passing in an instance as an item in the `availableBrushes` prop on the `SuperCanvas` component. For example, if you had a custom `LocationPinBrush`, you would make it available to use in the component like this.

```jsx
<SuperCanvas
	...
	availableBrushes={[
		new LocationPinBrush(),
	]}
/>
```

## `interface IBrush`

<InterfaceDocumentation interfaceMetadata={IBrushMeta} />
