# The `IBrush` interface

All super canvas brushes implement this interface and can be made usable in the editor by passing in an instance as an item in the `availableBrushes` prop on the `SuperCanvas` component. For example, if you had a custom `LocationPinBrush`, you would make it available to use in the component like this.

```jsx
<SuperCanvas
	...
	availableBrushes={[
		new LocationPinBrush(),
	]}
/>
```

## `interface IBrush`

<InterfaceDocumentation interfaceMetadata={IBrushMeta} />

## Default brushes

The super canvas package exports a few default brush classes that can be plugged right into the `SuperCanvas` component.

* `CircleBrush` - Draws circles (exposes `CircleCanvasItem`)
* `PolygonBrush` - Draws a polygon (exposes `PolygonCanvasItem`)
* `ImageBrush` - Stamps an image (exposes `ImageCanvasItem`)

```tsx
import {
	CircleBrush,
	PolygonBrush,
	ImageBrush,
} from 'react-super-canvas/defaults';
import { SuperCanvas } from 'react-super-canvas';

// ...

<SuperCanvas
	...
	availableBrushes={[
		new CircleBrush(),
		new PolygonBrush(),
		new ImageBrush('http://www.example.com/my-image.jpg'),
	]}
/>
```

## Remarks on `supportedCanvasItem`

The usage of `supportedCanvasItems` might be a little bit confusing. Say you have a brush called `CharacterBrush` that can paint NPCs and PCs on a map. Say that NPCs and PCs are both rendered by the `NPCCanvasItem` class and `PCCanvasItem` class respectively. Your declaration for `CharacterBrush` might look a little bit like the following.

```ts
export default class CharacterBrush implements IBrush {
	supportedCanvasItems = {
		PCCanvasItem,
		NPCCanvasItem,
	}
}
```

This is how the super canvas can map pure JSON output to the `ICanvasItem` class that it is supposed to be an instance of.
