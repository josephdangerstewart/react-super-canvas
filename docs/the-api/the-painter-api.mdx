# The Painter API

The painter api is an API for virtually rendering things absolutely to the HTML5 canvas element. This should always be used instead of the canvas rendering context.

## Methods

1. `drawLine(line: Line) => void` - Draws a line in the virtual canvas space
2. `drawImage(topLeftCorner: Vector2D, imageUrl: string) => void` - Draws an image in the virtual canvas space
3. `drawRect(rect: Rectangle) => void` - Draws a rectangle in the virtual canvas space
4. `drawCircle(circle: Circle) => void` - Draws a circle in the virtual space
