# Changelog

#### 2.4.1

- Respect fill image url in polygon canvas items

### 2.4.0

- Added the ability to undo rearrange and lock/unlock operations
- Improved zoom scrolling on the canvas to make it smoother

### 2.3.0

- Added the ability to rearrange the canvas
- Fixed bug where copying items would copy them in the order they were selected

### 2.2.0

- Added the ability to lock canvas items
- Added support for canvas item metadata, data about canvas items that canvas items do not own to more easily support global canvas item operations (locking in this instance, but possibly hiding and layering in the future)

#### 2.1.1

- Changed `translationOnPaste` to a more sensible default (15, 15) -> (0, 0)

### 2.1.0

- Added the ability to copy paste, as well as the ability to hook into those events
- Fixed a bug where rotation wasn't being preserved on the polygon and image default canvas items

#### 2.0.1

- Fixed a bug where `rotatePolygon` was rotating the points geometrically and then adjusting the rotation value so there was no change in actual rotation of the shape

## 2.0.0

- **Breaking change:** Changed the shape that canvas items are converted to when calling `onChange`, any data output from versions 1.x.x will not work with 2.0.0 and above. This was changed so that if the super canvas is passed in a model that contains canvas items it does not have knowledge of, it will still render it as a generic canvas item. In previous versions, in order for a canvas item to be reconstructed from a saved state, the super canvas component needed to be passed in a brush in `availableBrushes` that contained the original canvas item class in `supportedCanvasItems`. Now, if the super canvas does not see a corresponding `supportedCanvasItem` for a given canvas item in the model, it will instantiate that canvas item as a generic canvas item that can still be rendered. This will make it easer to display graphics created with the super canvas.
- Made `toJson` optional for more basic canvas items
- Added ability for canvas items to be rotatable using `applyRotation` as well as rotation methods

I was not as forward thinking as I should have been so the changelog stops here... sorry :/
